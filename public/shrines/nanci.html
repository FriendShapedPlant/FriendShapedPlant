				<p style="clear:both;">Nanci is a sleepy little chinese girl, the titular character of the blind box series by Rolife. Her most iconic features are her twin buns, slightly tilted head, resting eyes, and snot bubble. She's always peacefully dreaming, and invokes a similar peace and whimsy in her fans, including me!</p>
				<p>I don't need another collection of physical trinkets, so I figured I'd "collect" them on my website instead!</p>
