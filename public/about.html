				<p>I took my first HTML class in the summer of 2022, but before then I had some experience with customizing my DeviantART page in  2016-ish. I love me some programming but this is definitely my favorite language lmao. I also obviously know CSS and Javascript! It all goes hand in hand. :3</p>
				<p>Outside of webmastering, I love drawing, cosplaying, and playing video games. Some of my faves are Kirby, OFF, Undertale/Deltarune, Len'en Project, and Pump it Up. I'm all about indie and rhythm games, and I stream the former on my <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/friendshapedplant" target="_blank">Twitch!</a></p>
				<p>I am also VERY leftist. My activism is focused on disability and queer rights, but I stand in solidarity with many other minorities.</p>
				<p>If it wasn't apparent, my fave aesthetics currently are old web and bright colors :3 I do love me some punkish fashion though, half my shirts are black lmao, but I've adopted some more kidcore-esque pieces as of late. I'm in my anemoia-nostalgia era.</p>
