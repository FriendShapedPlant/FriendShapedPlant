    <title>October</title>

      More indie site links, new art, new fragrance mists in the Bath and Body Works Collection (lird help me), and I've put the work into updating my URL in many places! 
      Fixed my guestbook to redirect to here, as well as my button code. Most fanlistings automatically updated, but for the rest and the webrings I had to send out emails. Heres to hoping those all switch over eventually!
      Also PLEASE tell me my feed is working now I had like 3 other updates between my first and this that I never saw get sent out QwQ hell world. I deleted them I hope that kills this curse
