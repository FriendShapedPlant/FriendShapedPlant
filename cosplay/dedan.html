                    <p>For years, I knew that I wanted my first cosplay post-top surgery to be Dedan. I mean, look at that battle sprite art. Bro undeniably has scars to many fans. Finishing this cosplay just so happened to line up with the release of the OFF remaster as well!</p>

                    <p>This thing is an absolute NIGHTMARE to wear (low vision, can't use hands, platform boots, coat sweaty) but I feel so fucking epic wearing it regardless.</p>

                    <h2>Jacket</h2>
                    <p>I started looking for a trenchcoat long before my top surgery and it still took me years to find this one. I wanted a pure white, double breasted trenchcoat, which are surprisingly not very common. I got it secondhand on Mercari by sheer luck. It appears factory-made, but no indication of origin unfortunately. It is admitedly a little small for me but I make do!</p>
                    <p>The epaulettes were added by me using as close of a fabric texture I could find at JoAnn's (rest in peace queen). The buttons were also originally black, so I replaced those with white ones.</p>
                    <p>One day I would love to add a sketchy-like texture to the jacket—yknow like how Jojo/Borderlands cosplayers will cell shade their cosplays—to match the sketchy style of the game. Thats a daunting task I will have to practice for. And hopefully find a bigger trench coat by then.</p>

                    <h2>Head</h2>
                    <p>This was my first time (properly) making something out of foam in years, so its a bit rough. I used <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/928887142/basic-helmet-no2-diy-printable-eva-foam">Mellow Mind Cosplay's Basic helmet No.2 pattern</a> as a base off the reccomendation of a fellow Dedan cosplayer. After assembly, I cut out the shape of the eye holes(?) with a blade and the teeth with a dremel cutting disc. The slits between the teeth are big enough for me to see through <em>just</em> a smidge.</p>
                    <p>I had really fucking bad gapping in the foam seams which I partially remedied with kwik-seal. For the lips/gums around the teeth, I used some paper maché that doesn't look very good but its fine. Hit it with a few coats of plasti-dip and white spray paint, black between the teeth to accentuate the gaps between them, and a few layers of mesh over the sides to finish the base off. I used a hole saw bit to cut out the eyes 'cause trying to free-hand a circle is hard! They got the same plasti-dip spray paint treatment.</p>

                    <h2>Hands</h2>
                    <p>I printed the hands out of inland bone white PLA using <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4342323">Julien Jeanroy's Articulated Finger Extension models</a>. I didn't modify these to fit my hands (how do I do that) so theyre rather large. One of the fingers did snap under pressure while at a convention, but I've since learned that print angle can determine durability. I printed a replacement piece, a benefit of making these myself :)</p>
                    <p>I bought a pair of <a href="https://www.welovecolors.com/shop/womens/gloves/short-matte-seamless-gloves">We Love Colors Seamless White Gloves</a> to wear under, but the plastic would snag on the material, making it pill. My homie has gloves he got with his displate purchases which work alot better with the fingers.</p>
                
                    <h2>Other</h2>
                    <p>White pants were a pretty easy thrift, and the boots are demonia swing-815 in black pleather and with wide calves. I also tried out mehron fantasy FX cream for my neck and chest but I could not get that shit to apply evenly. To be fair it was also my first time trying body paint maybe I don't know what I'm doing!</p>
